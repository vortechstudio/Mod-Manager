compressing textures into various GPU-friendly formats.

To use the Photoshop plug-in:

   * In Photoshop, go to File > Save a Copy...
   * Change the file type under the file name to "DDS - NVIDIA Texture Tools Exporter" or "KTX2 - NVIDIA Texture Tools Exporter".
   * Click Save.
   * Select your format from the top-left Format dropdown.
   * Press Save in the bottom right, or press Ctrl-S.
   * You can also open DDS or KTX2 files using Photoshop's File > Open... .

To run the standalone:

   * Run nvtt_export.exe.

For more information of the use of command-line tools:

   * Open a "cmd" window and run each of the executables with the -h argument.

* Select or hover over settings to show a tooltip with useful information!
* The Exporter can be controlled entirely from the keyboard.
  - CTRL+O: Open
  - CTRL+S: Save
  - CTRL+Tab: Activate keyboard navigation and cycle between panes.
  - Arrow keys: Move through items. Add Shift to go backwards.
  - Tab: Move through only items that accept text input. Add Shift to go backwards.
  - Enter: Enter text input on item.
  - Space: Enter slider/combo input on item (use arrow keys), or toggle checkbox.
  - Escape: Exit item input.
  - ALT+F4: Close window.
* The Photoshop plugin supports scripting using Photoshop Actions, and the
standalone version has a command-line interface and supports batch files.
Open a command line and run
  "C:\Program Files\NVIDIA Corporation\NVIDIA Texture Tools\nvtt_export.exe" --help
to see a list of command-line options.
* Unchecked "Show This Dialog" in the Photoshop plugin when opening a DDS file,
but want to see the "DDS Read Properties" again? You can re-enable it from
Help > About Plugins > DDS - NVIDIA Texture Tools Exporter.

================================================================================
Known Issues
================================================================================
* ASTC HDR modes are not supported.

================================================================================
New in 3.2.5
================================================================================
* Added `nvtt::MipmapFilter_Mitchell`, `nvtt::{MipmapFilter, ResizeFilter}_Min`,
and `nvtt::{MipmapFilter, ResizeFilter}_Max`.
* Attempting to create an `nvtt::Surface` with a width, height, or depth that
would overflow an underlying integer type now produces an error instead
of overflowing.
* nvcompress: Fixed a crash on Windows when attempting to compress more than
509 files at once, due to exhaustion of Windows C++ runtime file handles.
* nvcompress: Fixed a crash on Windows when attempting to compress a directory
whose files' names' included characters outside of the active OS code page.
* nvcompress: Fixed an off-by-one error when computing the number of mipmaps
that could be generated.
* Exporter: Added Resize effect.
* Exporter: Added Mitchell-Netravali mipmapping filter.
* Exporter: The “Override Filter Parameters” UI now shows the full set of
parameters NVTT supports for each resizing filter, along with dedicated names
and tooltips for each one.
* Exporter: Added Swizzle effect.
* Exporter: Added --max-mip-count, which sets the maximum number of mipmaps
(including the base mip) to generate, and --min-mip-size, which sets the minimum
width or size of any mip.
* Exporter: --no-mips now only controls whether mips are read from DDS and KTX
files. Previously, it also controlled mip generation. The 2023.3.2 --no-mips
option is equivalent to 2024.1’s --no-mips --max-mip-count 1.
* Exporter: Improved GLEW initialization compatibility.

================================================================================
New in 3.2.4
================================================================================
* Fixed naming of NVTT_VERSION fields to make the mapping to semantic versioning
clearer. For instance, NVTT 3.2.4 is fork 3, major version 2 (incremented on
API breaks), minor version 4 (incremented on new features and bug fixes).
* Added a safer 4-argument overload of `TimingContext::GetRecord()`, which takes
the size of the buffer to write the description to, and deprecated the
3-argument version.
* Exporter: Updated libwebp to fix CVE-2023-4863/CVE-2023-5129, in which a
malicious .webp file could make the libwebp library execute arbitrary code.
The Exporter used libwebp via FreeImage; the NVTT library does not use libwebp
and was not affected.
* Exporter: Fixed incorrect JPEG decoding due to FreeImage defaulting to an
approximate inverse discrete cosine transform (IDCT) instead of a precise IDCT.
* Exporter GUI: Changed the "Compression Quality" header to "Compression Effort"
to clarify that higher effort makes compressors search through more blocks and
usually take more time to produce better results. In other words, as effort
increases, the quality of the output usually increases, but the file size
remains the same.
* Exporter: Now supports paths longer than 260 characters.
* Exporter: The DDS writer now sets the DDPF_LUMINANCE flag for L8 textures.

================================================================================
New in 3.2.3
================================================================================
* BC1-BC3: Fixes a bug in 3.2.2 where CUDA compression on Turing GPUs would
produce a `cudaErrorIllegalAddress` error.
* Fixes a bug where `nvtt::Surface::createSubImage` and `nvtt::Surface::diff()`
did not copy the texture type, alpha mode, wrap mode, or normal flag from their
input(s) to their output `nvtt::Surface`.
* Exporter: If an image causes the Exporter to switch from GPU to CPU
compression, the intermediate results are now fully cleared before restarting
image processing. This fixes a bug where images loaded on devices with compute
capability < 5.0 would display with the wrong color space (which would resolve
if the settings were modified).
* Exporter GUI: Fixed bugs in extension autocompletion (for instance, saving a
PNG image named "test" adds the .png extension if test.png does not exist).

================================================================================
New in 3.2.2
================================================================================
* BC1-BC3,BC1a: Improved compression quality at Quality::Production|Highest.
* BC7,ASTC: Fixes a bug where images marked opaque would use a transparent
compressor, and images marked transparent would use an opaque compressor.
* Improved nvcompress' performance on images over 6.25 megapixels.
* Added --max-mip-count, --nim-mip-size, and --no-mip-gamma-correct options to
nvcompress.
* Renamed nvbatchcompress.exe to nvbatchcompress.bat; nvbatchcompress'
functionality has been merged into nvcompress.
* Retargeted CUDA dependency to version 11.8.
* Exporter: Added the Edge Pad (Solidify) effect, which smoothly fills
transparent areas of images.
* Exporter: Added read and write support for the RXGB BC3 normal map format.
* Exporter: Improved power usage by reducing window draw frequency when idle.
* Exporter: File paths are now stored using Unicode instead of ANSI characters.
This fixes a bug where paths with non-ANSI characters would fail to open and
print mojibake error messages.
* Exporter: The DDS reader can now successfully read some images where
DDS_MIPMAPCOUNT is missing from dwFlags.
* Exporter: Improved DDS reader support for uncommon modes such as D3DFMT_CxV8U8
and DDPF_BUMPDUDV.
* Exporter: Fixed a crash when reading bitmasked DDS files with dwRGBBitCount
set to 0 or with subresources between 1 and 7 bytes long.
* Exporter: Fixed a bug where image processing would fail or stall on GPUs with
compute capability less than 5.0.
* Exporter: Normal textures now have the DDPF_NORMAL flag set.
* Exporter: Volume textures now have the DDSCAPS2_VOLUME flag set.
* Exporter: The NVIDIA DDS Read Properties window can now be closed.
* Exporter: Invalid --serialized-effects-v1 strings no longer cause crashes.
* Exporter: Fixed a bug where --mip-filter-width would always be written to
settings, even when Override Filter Width was unchecked.
* Exporter standalone: Fixed a bug where atlas and cubemap settings would be
ignored when reading a command line or preset.
* Exporter standalone: Fixed a race condition where if several dozen nvtt_export
instances were started at the same time, they could mistake each other for the
installer and refuse to launch.

================================================================================
New in 3.2.1
================================================================================
* Optimized CPU-to-GPU transfers, giving faster compression when using the
`nvtt::Context` API and `nvtt::Surface` data is not in VRAM.
* BC1-BC5: Optimized kernel parameters for faster compression.
* BC1/BC1a: Improved compression quality when the input block has close to a
flat color.
* CPU BC1: Fixes a bug where the compressor would sometimes encode transparent
single-color blocks with transparency.
* GPU BC1a: New fast-mode compressor when input data is on the GPU.
* GPU BC6: Improved compressor speed by merging partition kernels.
* Adds `nvtt::Surface::loadFromMemory()`,
`nvtt::SurfaceSet::loadDDSFromMemory()`, and
`nvtt::CubeSurface::loadFromMemory()`. These variants of
`nvtt::Surface::load()`, `nvtt::SurfaceSet::loadDDS()`, and
`nvtt::CubeSurface::load()` work on in-memory data. (Thank you to mijalko on the
NVIDIA Developer Forums.)
* Fixes a bug where the CPU BC1 compressor would sometimes encode transparent
single-color blocks with transparency. (Thank you to tgrimmer on the NVIDIA
Developer Forums.)
* Adds range checks on the parameters of `nvtt::Surface::toRGBE()`,
`nvtt::Surface::fromRGBE()`, and `nvtt::Surface()::quantize()`.
* Updated stb_image dependency.
* Exporter: Fixes a bug where DDS cube maps were written with an arraySize 6x
the correct number.
* Exporter: Improves OpenGL compatibility by removing usage of
`glGetTextureLevelParameteriv()`.
* Exporter: Fixes a bug where `nvtt_export --help` opened the GUI after printing
help info.
* Exporter plugin: Fixes a bug where grayscale images with alpha were
interpreted in (red, alpha, 0, 1) format.

================================================================================
New in 3.2.0
================================================================================
* Adds precompiled kernels for Hopper and Ada GPUs.
* Adds `nvtt::nvtt_encode()` and `nvtt::EncodeSettings` to the low-level API.
`nvtt_encode()` unifies all low-level compression functions under a single
interface, and `nvtt::EncodeSettings` can be extended to add new features
without breaking the API.
* Adds 16-bit half float (`nvtt::ValueType::FLOAT16`) as an input to the
low-level API.
* Adds `nvtt::SetMessageCallback()`. NVTT now reports errors, warnings, and
messages through each thread's message callback. In particular, this can be used
to detect errors even when a function does not return `bool`.
* Adds `nvtt::Surface::gpuDataMutable()`. This allows NVTT Surface data to be
used with your own custom CUDA kernels, without requiring a `const_cast`.
* Adds unclamped sRGB transfer functions. These allow HDR images to be converted
to sRGB and back without significant information loss:
  - `nvtt::Surface::toSrgbUnclamped()`
  - `nvtt::Surface::toLinearFromSrgbUnclamped()`
* Adds `nvtt::Surface::toLinearFromXenonSrgb()`, the inverse of
`nvtt::Surface::toXenonSrgb()`.
* Adds BC3n GPU compressor.
* Faster BC6H GPU compression.
* Fixes an out-of-bounds write within the BC2 GPU compressor.
* Fixes a bug where the C wrapper and C++ Error enumerations didn't match.
* Fixes a bug where the slow-mode BC1 CPU compressor would sometimes output
blocks with alpha, if the input had variegated blocks with semitransparent
pixels. (Thank you to tgrimmer on the NVIDIA Developer Forums.)
* Fixes a bug where `nvtt::Surface::toSrgb()` turned 1.0 into 0.999999940
instead of 1.
* Fixes a bug where `nvttContextQuantize()` was missing from the C wrapper
symbols. (Thank you to mijalko on the NVIDIA Developer Forums.)

================================================================================
